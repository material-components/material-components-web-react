              Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with
              Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmers
              wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be
              carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a
              roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty
              looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or
              four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed
              in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There
              was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in
              the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in
              case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush
              any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the
              middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small,
              dark hole.
            </p>
            <p className='mdc-typography--body1'>
              When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could
              see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree
              nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to
              the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the
              plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through
              it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops
              of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen
              everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun
              blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the
              house was as dull and gray as everything else.
            </p>
            <p className='mdc-typography--body1'>
              When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The
              sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle
              from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red
              from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin
              and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan,
              first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the childs
              laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart
              whenever Dorothys merry voice reached her ears; and she still
              looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find
              anything to laugh at.
            </p>
            <p className='mdc-typography--body1'>
              Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night
              and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long
              beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and
              rarely spoke.
            </p>
            <p className='mdc-typography--body1'>
              It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing
              as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a
              little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that
              twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto
              played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him
              dearly.
            </p>
            <p className='mdc-typography--body1'>
              Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the
              doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer
              than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and
              looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.
            </p>
            <p className='mdc-typography--body1'>
              From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle
              Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves
              before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the
              air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they
              saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.
