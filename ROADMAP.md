# MDC React Roadmap
We are experiencing some temporary changes for Q1. Resources for MDC React have moved to MDC Web to build out Typescript! 

_Do not worry_ ~ we're not going anywhere. This means we will not be adding new features/fixing bugs (unless it is a showstopper --> causing a package to not work or break existing functionality). We will still be supporting any open source contribution submitted (Pull requests and issues). If you would like to see a new feature or bug fix from MDC Web, please see our [contributions doc](./docs/contributions/README.md).

For any additional questions or clarification please visit us on our [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/material-components), and thanks for helping us grow this community and library during this time.

<!-- We release a new version of MDC React every 2 weeks. We try and keep MDC React within one version of MDC Web. This roadmap is based of the [MDC Web roadmap](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), but specific to MDC React. -->
