# MDC React Roadmap
We are experiencing some temporary changes for Q1. Resources for MDC React have moved to MDC Web to build out Typescript! 

_Do not worry_ ~ we're not going anywhere. This means we will not be adding new features/fixing bugs (unless it is a showstopper --> causing a package to not work or break existing functionality). We will still be supporting any open source contribution submitted (Pull requests and issues). If you would like to see a new feature or bug fix from MDC Web, please see our [contributions doc](./docs/contributions/README.md).

For any additional questions or clarification please visit us on our [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/material-components), and thanks for helping us grow this community and library during this time.
