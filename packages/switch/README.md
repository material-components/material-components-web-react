# React Switch

A React version of an [MDC Switch](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-switch).

## Installation

```
npm install @material/react-switch
```

## Usage

### Styles

with Sass:
```js
import '@material/react-switch/index.scss';
```

with CSS:
```js
import "@material/react-switch/dist/switch.css";
```

### Javascript Instantiation

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import Switch from '@material/react-switch';

class MyApp extends Component {
  state = {checked: false};

  render() {
    return (
      <Switch
        nativeControlId='my-switch'
        checked={this.state.checked}
        onChange={(e) => this.setState({checked: e.target.checked})} />
      <label htmlFor='my-switch'>My Switch</label>
    );
  }
}
```

> _NOTE_: In order to get access to the checked value, you must add an `onChange` handler that accepts an `Event` and updates a checked state as shown above.

--- | --- | ---
className | String | Classes to be applied to the switch element
checked | Boolean | Indicates whether the switch is checked ("on")
disabled | Boolean | Indicates whether the switch is disabled
nativeControlId | String | Id attached to the native control for relationship with the label
