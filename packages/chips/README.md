# React Chips

A React version of an [MDC Chips](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-chips).

## Installation

```
npm install @material/react-chips
```

## Usage

### Styles

with Sass:
```js
import '@material/react-chips/index.scss';
```

with CSS:
```js
import "@material/react-chips/dist/chips.css";
```

### Javascript Instantiation

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import ChipSet from '@material/react-chips';

class MyApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ChipSet>
        <Chip label='Summer'/>
        <Chip label='Winter'/>
      </ChipSet>
    );
  }
}
```

## Variants

### Selection

There are two types of chips that allow for selection: [choice chips](https://material.io/design/components/chips.html#choice-chips) for single selection, and [filter chips](https://material.io/design/components/chips.html#filter-chips) for multiple selection. You can indicate a `Chip` is selected by adding the `selected` prop. Due to React's uni-directional data flow, you are expected write your own selection logic and pass a callback to the `Chip` through the `handleSelect` prop.

#### Choice chips

```js
class MyChoiceChips extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedChipId: -1,
  };

  isSelected = (id) => {
    return this.state.selectedChipId === id;
  }

  handleSelect = (id) => {
    if (this.isSelected(id)) {
      this.setState({selectedChipId: -1});
    } else {
      this.setState({selectedChipId: id});
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ChipSet>
        <Chip label='Small' selected={this.isSelected(0)} handleSelect={() => this.handleSelect(0)}/>
        <Chip label='Medium' selected={this.isSelected(1)} handleSelect={() => this.handleSelect(1)}/>
        <Chip label='Large' selected={this.isSelected(2)} handleSelect={() => this.handleSelect(2)}/>
      </ChipSet>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Filter chips

Filter chips include a leading checkmark to indicate selection. To define a set of chips as filter chips, add the `filter` prop to the `ChipSet`. 

```js
class MyFilterChips extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedChipIds: new Set(),
  };

  isSelected = (id) => {
    return this.state.selectedChipIds.has(id);
  }

  handleSelect = (id) => {
    const selectedChipIds = new Set(this.state.selectedChipIds);
    if (this.isSelected(id)) {
      selectedChipIds.delete(id);
    } else {
      selectedChipIds.add(id);
    }
    this.setState({selectedChipIds});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ChipSet filter>
        <Chip label='Tops' selected={this.isSelected(0)} handleSelect={() => this.handleSelect(0)}/>
        <Chip label='Bottoms' selected={this.isSelected(1)} handleSelect={() => this.handleSelect(1)}/>
        <Chip label='Shoes' selected={this.isSelected(2)} handleSelect={() => this.handleSelect(2)}/>
      </ChipSet>
    );
  }
}
```

### Input chips

Input chips are a variant of chips which enable user input by converting text into chips. Chips may be dynamically added and removed from the chip set. To define a set of chips as input chips, add the `input` prop to the `ChipSet`. To remove a chip, pass a callback to the `Chip` through the `handleRemove` prop.

> _NOTE_: We recommend you store an array of chip labels and their respective IDs in the `state` to manage adding/removing chips. Do _NOT_ use the chip's index as its ID or key, because its index may change due to the addition/removal of other chips.

```js
class MyInputChips extends React.Component {
  state = {
    chips: [
      {label: 'Jane Smith', id: 0},
      {label: 'John Doe', id: 1}
    ],
    nextId: 2,
  };

  addChip(label) {
    const id = this.state.nextId;
    const newChip = {label, id};

    // Create a new chips array to ensure that a re-render occurs.
    // See: https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#do-not-modify-state-directly
    const chips = [...this.state.chips]; 
    chips.push(newChip);
    this.setState({chips, nextId: id + 1});
  }

  handleKeyDown = (e) => {
    // If you have a more complex input, you may want to store the value in the state.
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && e.target.value) {
      this.addChip(e.target.value);
      e.target.value = '';
    }
  }

  handleRemoveChip = (id) => {
    const chips = [...this.state.chips];
    const index = chips.findIndex(chip => chip.id === id);
    chips.splice(index, 1);
    this.setState({chips});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" onKeyDown={this.handleKeyDown} />
        <ChipSet input>
          {this.state.chips.map((chip) =>
            <Chip
              key={chip.id} // The chip's key cannot be its index, because its index may change.
              label={chip.label}
              removeIcon={<MaterialIcon icon='cancel' />}
              handleRemove={() => this.handleRemoveChip(chip.id)}
            />
          )}
        </ChipSet>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Props

### Chip Set

Prop Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
className | String | Classes to be applied to the chip set element
filter | Boolean | Indicates that the chips in the set are filter chips, which allow multiple selection from a set of options
input | Boolean | Indicates that the chips in the set are input chips, which allow dynamic adding/removing of chips

### Chip

Prop Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
className | String | Classes to be applied to the chip element
label | String | Text to be shown on the chip
leadingIcon | Element | An icon element that appears as the leading icon.
removeIcon | Element | An icon element that appears as the remove icon. Clicking on it should remove the chip.

## Sass Mixins

Sass mixins may be available to customize various aspects of the Components. Please refer to the
MDC Web repository for more information on what mixins are available, and how to use them.
