# React Text Field

MDC React Text Field is component for MDC Text Field. Please see [MDC Text Field](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-textfield/).

## Installation

```
npm install @material/react-text-field
```

## Usage

### Styles

with Sass:
```js
import '@material/react-text-field/index.scss';
```

with CSS:
```js
import '@material/react-text-field/dist/text-field.css';
```

### Javascript Instantiation

React Text Field accepts one child element which is the input element. For ease of integration, we have provided an input component to be used with React Text Field.

```js
import React from 'react';
import TextField, {HelperText, Input} from '@material/react-text-field';

class MyApp extends React.Component {
  state = {value: 'Woof'};

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <TextField
          label='Dog'
          helperText={<HelperText>Help Me!</HelperText>}
        >
          <Input
            value={this.state.value}
            onChange={(e) => this.setState({value: e.target.value})}/>
        </TextField>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

> NOTE: In order to get access to the value, you must add an onChange handler, which accepts an event and updates the value of the input as shown above.
